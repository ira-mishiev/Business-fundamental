# Abstract



Getty Images is an online platform that supplies stock images. The company works with photographers around the world. The company's customers vary from magazine editors, newspaper publishers, bloggers, and any business that needs visual content. Getty Images takes a percentage from every sale; therefore, the company is interested in collecting and selling more expensive photos. Prices range from $0.5 to tens of thousands of dollars; therefore, the company wants to motivate contributors to create content that is in demand and at higher prices. 


Impact Hypothesis: If photographers have access to comprehensive data analysis tools that show what kind of content values, they will be motivated to create this kind of content. 
Measures of success: 
non-technical - increasing average revenue per photo from $53 (current average revenue) and business's total revenue during the following year. 
Technical- as a first step creating comprehensive data analysis tools for photographers that would positively impact the business's profit.
Risks and assumptions:
Making a photo is a creative and unpredictable process, so that recommendation could have been impossible to realize. 
If to make the same recommendations for all photographers in a specific location, the content can be similar.

# Data
I will use personal data with photo sales made between 2017-2020. Every row in the table contains the following features: date, id, description, price, customer's name, photo usage, news outlets, and country where the photo was purchased.
 
# Design
This project aims to increase the company's profit by motivating photographers to make more valuable on-market photos. Creating aggregated data tables and visualization would help identify what kind of photos make more than the average revenue per sale and describe the potential clients that buy more expensive content. Having access to these insights, contributors potentially would use this knowledge and try to make photos with higher revenue. 

# Tools:
Google Sheets and Tableau for data analysis and visualization. 
# Algorithms
Google Sheets for data analysis, aggregation, cleaning, and visualizations. Tableau for data exploration and visualization.
